Our ETL project proposal and Leah is putting a copy of this on our github repo.Summary:
Our project will involve using national park datasets. We will be using the name of the national park name as the primary filter for the data to create a final database. Considerations for the final table to include: popularity of trails, elevation gain of trails, visitations, potentially tourism, and size (acres) of parks.
Data Sources:
·       https://www.kaggle.com/planejane/national-park-trails
o  The dataset is from the AllTrails app and provides trail information.
·       https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity?select=parks.csv
o  The dataset is from National Park Service and provides size (acres) of parks.
·       https://data.world/inform8n/us-national-parks-visitation-1904-2016-with-boundaries/workspace/file?filename=All+National+Parks+Visitation+1904-2016.csv
o  The dataset is already scraped from the National Park Service website and provides visitations by year.
