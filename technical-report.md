## ETL-Project Technical Report

### Overview

Our objective is to gather various datasets about national parks, transform the data into workable dataframes, and load them into a SQL database. 

To do this, we found a dataset that listed all National Parks, acreage, latitude, and longitude. Then supplemented this with three other datasets. The first containing all trails within national parks and various stats pertaining to the trail; the second gave is number of visitors; the third, all animals found within the national parks.

We cleaned and normalized our data so that we could merge them into meaningful tables and load them into a SQL database.
